Objective: To determine the items on the plate.
Available items: {AVAILABLE_ITEMS}


You have been given an image of a plate. From the available items, what items are present, as a comma-separated list? After each item, output the number of bites it should take to eat that food item. This will always be either 1 or 2 bites.
Format your answer in one-line as follows: first_item X, second_item Y, third_item Z. X represents the number of bites. This should always be one.
Do not list an item that is not in the given list of available items. Assume that everything on the plate is listed in the available items. 
Do not return a food item which is not present in the "Available Items" list. If 3 different food items are on the plate then the list should contain 3 food items. If there is only one type of food then you should only output one food item and bite number. Make sure the number of distinguishable items detected is the number of elements in the list.
Always return an item on the list, unless there is absolutely no object detected.If there is no food detected on the plate, output "none".
